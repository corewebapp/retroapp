This is one of the convention built-in for Asp.net Core MVC, called Areas. We actually don't use area, it here
becuase of the scaffolded/generated Identity folder. Idendity folder helps us provide user authentication module
so we don't have to make it ourselves. 

What actually area is, can be found in the [official documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-3.1)
